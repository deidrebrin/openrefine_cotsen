# Lesson

## How OpenRefine records what you have done

As you conduct your data cleaning and preliminary analysis, OpenRefine saves every change you make to the dataset. These
changes are saved in a format known as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). You can export this JSON script and apply it to other data files. If you had 20 files to clean, and they all had the same type of errors (e.g. misspellings, leading white spaces), and all files had the same column names, you could save the JSON script, open a new file to clean in OpenRefine, paste in the script and run it.
This is particularly useful if you have to make the same types of edits to process data generated by instruments (i.e. pXRF or a Total Station). 

## Saving your work as a script

1. In the `Undo / Redo` section, click `Extract...`, and select the steps that you want to apply to other datasets by clicking the check boxes.

2. Copy the code from the right hand panel and paste it into a text editor (like NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac). Make sure it saves as a plain text file. In TextEdit, do this by selecting `Format` > `Make plain text` and save the file as a `.txt` file.

## Importing a script to use against another dataset

The following steps show how to import and apply the same changes to a dataset.

1. Start a new project in OpenRefine using the new dataset. Give the project a new name.  
2. Click the `Undo / Redo` tab > `Apply` and paste in the contents of `.txt` file with the JSON code.
3. Click `Perform operations`. The dataset should now be processed and ready for the next step!
